## Required settings

- `BOT_TOKEN`: from BotFather
- `REQUIRED_CHANNEL`: `@channelusername` for public channels, or `-100...` for private channels.
- `CHANNEL_JOIN_URL` (optional): if channel is private (recommended), set invite link.

## Important

For membership checking to work reliably:
- The bot should be **admin** in the channel.
- If the channel is private, you must use its numeric chat_id and provide a join link.
